        Brawl Stars is a multiplayer online battle arena and hero shooter game where players battle against other players or AI opponents in multiple game modes. Players can choose between several characters called “Brawlers” that they have unlocked through Brawl Boxes (the game's version of a loot box), the Brawl Pass, the Trophy Road, or purchased through the Shop to use in battles.
